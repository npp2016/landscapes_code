**Results**
------------------
We split the vegetation structure dataset into its multiple components: Trees, shrubs, canopy, and ground cover. Data were collected between 8 July, 2013 and 16 July, 2013. Here we compare canopy cover, ground cover, shrub sizes and species, and tree sizes and species across and between sites.

**Figure 1** Canopy cover by site. There were `r richnesssite[1,2]`
